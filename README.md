See the notebook at [https://cpang4.github.io/object-recognition](https://cpang4.github.io/object-recognition)   
•	Used trained model with TensorFlow to detect objects in each frame of a video  
•	OpenCV used to add labels to frames and export to .mp4

*Video Object Recognition.ipynb* is the Jupyter Notebook with my code   
*frozen_inference_graph.pb* is the model from [TensorFlow Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) -ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco   
*labels.txt* are the corresponding [labels](https://github.com/nightrome/cocostuff/blob/master/labels.txt) for the model 
*index.html* is the result of running my Jupyter Notebook   
The jpg and .mp4 files are the inputs and outputs the model is tested on.
